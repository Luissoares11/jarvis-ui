# Jarvis UI

> Desktop interface for the Jarvis AI assistant — built with Electron + React.

A cinematic, Iron Man-inspired desktop app that connects to the [Jarvis API](https://github.com/Luissoares11/jarvis) and gives it a full visual interface. Dark terminal aesthetic, live data panels, and a mini overlay mode for quick access from anywhere on the desktop.

---

## Features

**Chat** — Full conversation interface with the Jarvis AI. Supports all natural language commands — memory, computation, weather, football, todos, reminders, calendar events, and more.

**Live panels** — Sidebar panels showing real-time data: current weather, active tasks, pending reminders, and upcoming events. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

**Tasks & Reminders** — Dedicated page to manage your to-do list and set reminders with a clean UI, without typing commands.

**Calendar** — View, add, and delete events. Toggle between upcoming and past events.

**Memory** — Browse everything Jarvis knows — facts about you, people you've mentioned, relationships — grouped by entity and deletable in one click.

**Settings** — Configure server URL, API token, and hotkey. Persisted locally across sessions.

**Mini mode** — Press `Ctrl+Space` anywhere on the desktop to bring up a small floating input bar. Type a command, get a response, press `Escape` to dismiss. No need to open the full app.

**System tray** — Closing the window minimizes to tray. Right-click for options, left-click to reopen.

**Interactive plots** — Mathematical graphs rendered with Plotly — zoomable, pannable, hoverable.
